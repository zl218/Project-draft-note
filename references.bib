abstract = {This paper presents an efficient parallel Adaptive Inverse Distance Weighting (AIDW) interpolation algorithm on modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The presented algorithm is an improvement of our previous GPU-accelerated AIDW algorithm by adopting fast
k
-nearest neighbors (
k
NN) search. In AIDW, it needs to find several nearest neighboring data points for each interpolated point to adaptively determine the power parameter; and then the desired prediction value of the interpolated point is obtained by weighted interpolating using the power parameter. In this work, we develop a fast
k
NN search approach based on the space-partitioning data structure, even grid, to improve the previous GPU-accelerated AIDW algorithm. The improved algorithm is composed of the stages of
k
NN search and weighted interpolating. To evaluate the performance of the improved algorithm, we perform five groups of experimental tests. The experimental results indicate: (1) the improved algorithm can achieve a speedup of up to 1017 over the corresponding serial algorithm; (2) the improved algorithm is at least two times faster than our previous GPU-accelerated AIDW algorithm; and (3) the utilization of fast
k
NN search can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the entire GPU-accelerated AIDW algorithm.},

abstract = {The KNN algorithm is one of the most popular data mining algorithms. It has been widely and successfully applied to data analysis applications across a variety of research topics in computer science. This paper illustrates that, despite its success, there remain many challenges in KNN classification, including K computation, nearest neighbor selection, nearest neighbor search and classification rules. Having established these issues, recent approaches to their resolution are examined in more detail, thereby providing a potential roadmap for ongoing KNN-related research, as well as some new classification rules regarding how to tackle the issue of training sample imbalance. To evaluate the proposed approaches, some experiments were conducted with 15 UCI benchmark datasets.},

(eds.), Recent Advances in Marine Geology and Environmental Oceanography. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 108, pp. 125–130. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. To reflect continuously and appreciably on the distribution of the average particle size of marine sediments, the geostatistical interpolation method based on GIS is used to predict the particle size of offshore sediments in a certain sea area in Liaoning. The kriging interpolation, the inverse distance weighting method, and polynomial interpolation method were used to spatially interpolate the particle size data of the experimental sites, and the cross-validation method was used to appraise the interpolation accuracy of the results. According to the results, in the case of limited data, the kriging interpolation method is the best. Inverse distance weighting method is better than polynomial interpolation method, but the interpolation results of the three methods all show a certain probability accuracy and can be used to predict a certain area. The particle size of the ocean substrate can be predicted and used by others.},
