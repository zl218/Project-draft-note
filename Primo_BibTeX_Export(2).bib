(eds.), Recent Advances in Marine Geology and Environmental Oceanography. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 108, pp. 125–130. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. To reflect continuously and appreciably on the distribution of the average particle size of marine sediments, the geostatistical interpolation method based on GIS is used to predict the particle size of offshore sediments in a certain sea area in Liaoning. The kriging interpolation, the inverse distance weighting method, and polynomial interpolation method were used to spatially interpolate the particle size data of the experimental sites, and the cross-validation method was used to appraise the interpolation accuracy of the results. According to the results, in the case of limited data, the kriging interpolation method is the best. Inverse distance weighting method is better than polynomial interpolation method, but the interpolation results of the three methods all show a certain probability accuracy and can be used to predict a certain area. The particle size of the ocean substrate can be predicted and used by others.},
